# Machine-Learning
Custom functions to ease the use of K-Means and K Nearest Neighbour in Python using the sklearn module. A report is included regarding the project I originally used it for - while unsuccessful overall, the code itself worked quite well. For linear regression tools check out my reverberation mapping repository.
