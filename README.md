# Machine-Learning
Custom functions to ease the use of machine learning algorithms in Python using the sklearn module. Right now I'm still teaching myself the intricacies of machine learning so improvements and additions will come in time!

A report is included regarding the project I originally used my K-Means function for - while unsuccessful overall, the code itself worked quite well. For linear regression tools check out my reverberation mapping repository.
